# Galaxy position finder ðŸŒŒ

This project retrieves the **Right Ascension (RA)** and **Declination (Dec)** of a list of galaxies from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database ([NED](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/)) and saves the results to a text file.

### Galaxy Data Source

The `galaxies.txt` file contains a curated list of 139 galaxy properties, sourced from [Steiner et al. 2022](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/510/4/5780/6501224), which were observed using Gemini Telescopes.


### Technical Details

This project leverages the NED API to retrieve galaxy information, enabling efficient and accurate data collection.


## ðŸ“œ **How It Works**
1. Reads galaxy names from `galaxies.txt`.  
2. Sends a **POST request** to the **NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)** using `requests`.  

3. Extracts **Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC)** from the JSON response.  
4. Saves the results in `galaxies_coords.txt`, ensuring the header is only added once.  



## ðŸ“Œ **Output Format**
The results are stored in a tab-separated `.txt` file, for example:  
```
Galaxy Name	RA	DEC
NGC 4030	180.0984929	-1.1000504
NGC 4697	192.1495343	-5.8006418
NGC 4775	193.4404369	-6.622408

```
